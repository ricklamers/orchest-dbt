### Orchest + dbt

[![Open in Orchest](https://github.com/orchest/orchest-examples/raw/main/imgs/open_in_orchest.svg)](https://cloud.orchest.io/?import_url=https://github.com/ricklamers/orchest-dbt/)

`dbt` is an excellent tool to help you run EL(T) transforms on your data warehouse (Snowflake, Postgres, Redshift, BigQuery).

It can be combined with Python/R/Julia easily using Orchest pipelines.

This repository demonstrates this by showing what an example hello-world pipeline looks like.

It's based on the `dbt` starter project [jaffle_shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop).
